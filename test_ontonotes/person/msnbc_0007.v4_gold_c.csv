so,0,113
we,0,113

're,0,113

I,0,115
simply,0,115

the,0,117

you,0,127

come,0,139
when,0,139

will,0,140
live,0,140
in,0,140

be,0,140

Uh,0,141
what,0,141
we,0,141
've,0,141

I,0,146

to,0,146
remember,0,146
about,0,146
those,0,146

by,0,146
the,0,147

they,0,147
were,0,147

the,0,149

that,0,150

we,0,152

on,0,180

the,0,181

outright,0,181

of,0,181

Oh,0,184
I,0,184

The,0,187
last,0,187

is,0,187
react,0,187

every,0,188
wild,0,188
statement,0,188
that,0,188
they,0,188

but,0,189
they,0,189
certainly,0,189
chose,0,189
that,0,189
to,0,189

what,0,191
they,0,191
've,0,191
got,0,191
to,0,191
realize,0,191

there,0,191

They,0,193
ca,0,193
n't,0,193
just,0,193

the,0,356

And,0,362
then,0,362
in,0,362
two,0,362

there,0,362
's,0,362
a,0,362

the,0,365

these,0,372

And,0,375
so,0,375
uh,0,375
we,0,375
have,0,375
n't,0,375
changed,0,375

We,0,378
are,0,378
very,0,378

they,0,379

how,0,379
much,0,379
they,0,379
've,0,379
denied,0,379

the,0,379
basic,0,379

we,0,380

/.,0,381
So,0,382
I,0,382
think,0,382
there,0,382
's,0,382
been,0,382
a,0,382

in,0,383
the,0,383

we,0,383

And,0,384
uh,0,384
we,0,384
're,0,384
determined,0,384
to,0,384

ahead,0,384

When,0,385
the,0,385

talked,0,385
about,0,385
the,0,385
axis,0,385
of,0,385

said,0,386
Iraq,0,386

/.,0,386
The,0,387

countries,0,387
Iraq,0,387
/.,0,387
Some,0,388
now,0,388
make,0,388
the,0,388
case,0,388
that,0,388
Iran,0,388
and,0,388
North,0,388
Korea,0,388
took,0,389
from,0,389
that,0,389
the,0,389
following,0,389
lesson,0,389
that,0,389
if,0,389
you,0,389
develop,0,389
a,0,389
nuclear,0,389
bomb,0,389
and,0,389
have,0,389
a,0,389
strong,0,389
military,0,389
you,0,389
will,0,389
not,0,389
be,0,389
invaded,0,389
by,0,389
the,0,389
US,0,389
/.,0,389
And,0,390
both,0,390
of,0,390
those,0,390
countries,0,390
have,0,390
clearly,0,390
miscalculated,0,390
their,0,390
own,0,390
situation,0,391
/.,0,391
Now,0,392
the,0,392
North,0,392
Koreans,0,392
felt,0,392
I,0,392
guess,0,392
that,0,392
by,0,392
testing,0,392
these,0,393
ballistic,0,393
missiles,0,393
they,0,393
would,0,393
somehow,0,393
put,0,393
themselves,0,393
in,0,393
a,0,393
position,0,393
of,0,393
greater,0,393
weight,0,393
in,0,393
the,0,393
negotiations,0,393
/.,0,393
They,0,394
've,0,394

you,0,394
've,0,394

they,0,395
've,0,395
done,0,395
/.,0,395
and,0,396
you,0,396
see,0,396
momentum,0,396
building,0,396
in,0,396
the,0,396
UN,0,396

/.,0,397
The,0,398
Iranians,0,398
have,0,398
miscalculated,0,398
/.,0,398
They,0,399
thought,0,399
that,0,399
they,0,399
could,0,399
divide,0,399

United,0,399

from,0,399
both,0,400

from,0,400

China,0,400
/.,0,400
But,0,401
we,0,401
've,0,401
been,0,401
able,0,401
to,0,401
craft,0,401
a,0,401
major,0,401

united,0,402

And,0,403
we,0,403
've,0,403
essentially,0,403
given,0,403
the,0,403
Iranians,0,403
a,0,403
clear,0,403
choice,0,403
/.,0,404
And,0,405
you,0,405
'll,0,405
see,0,405
a,0,405

of,0,405
this,0,405
unfold,0,405
this,0,405
week,0,406
both,0,406
in,0,406
Europe,0,406
when,0,406
Secretary,0,406

meets,0,406

At,0,406
the,0,406

of,0,406
the,0,406
week,0,406
when,0,406
the,0,406
president,0,406
is,0,406
there,0,406
/.,0,406
the,0,407
Iranians,0,407
are,0,407
going,0,407
to,0,407

to,0,407
choose,0,407
/.,0,407
Negotiations,0,408
with,0,408
us,0,408
after,0,408
they,0,408

further,0,409
action,0,409
in,0,409

So,0,410
I,0,410
do,0,410
n't,0,410
think,0,410
either,0,410
of,0,410
these,0,410

is,0,410
on,0,411
the,0,411
offensive,0,411
/.,0,411
Frankly,0,412
I,0,412
think,0,412
both,0,412
of,0,412
these,0,412
countries,0,412
are,0,412
rather,0,412
cornered,0,412
and,0,413
isolated,0,413
/.,0,413
There,0,414
are,0,414
very,0,414

/.,0,414
and,0,415
they,0,415
're,0,415
running,0,415
out,0,415

So,0,416
we,0,416
think,0,416
this,0,416
policy,0,416
of,0,416
patient,0,416
diplomacy,0,416
and,0,416
of,0,416
crafting,0,417

the,0,417

going,0,417

And,0,418
it,0,418
's,0,418
the,0,418
right,0,418

go,0,418
clearly,0,418
for,0,418
the,0,419
United,0,419

we,0,420
want,0,420

before,0,420
we,0,420
consider,0,420

I,0,565

nothing,0,565

the,0,571

about,0,573
whether,0,573
we,0,573

six,0,573

whether,0,573
we,0,573
stop,0,573
the,0,573
accumulation,0,573
of,0,573
plutonium,0,573
is,0,573
absurd,0,573
in,0,573
my,0,573

You,0,574
'd,0,574
have,0,574
some,0,574

had,0,575
said,0,575
prior,0,575
to,0,575
the,0,575

test,0,575
that,0,575
if,0,575
they,0,576

Now,0,577
that,0,577
they,0,577

you,0,577

This,0,579
is,0,579
kind,0,579
of,0,579
a,0,579
rule,0,579
I,0,579
think,0,579
that,0,579
you,0,579
really,0,580
try,0,580
hard,0,580
not,0,580
to,0,580
negotiate,0,580

And,0,581
I,0,581
think,0,581
a,0,581
decent,0,581
interval,0,581
now,0,581
and,0,581
some,0,581
work,0,581
at,0,582
the,0,582
United,0,582

is,0,582
the,0,582
appropriate,0,582
thing,0,582
to,0,582
do,0,582
/.,0,582
But,0,583
I,0,583
think,0,583
we,0,583
're,0,583
taking,0,583
a,0,583
view,0,583
from,0,583
thirty,0,583

what,0,585

It,0,586
needs,0,586
to,0,586

get,0,586
back,0,586
to,0,586
the,0,587

And,0,588
the,0,588
fact,0,588
that,0,588
you,0,588
may,0,588
get,0,588
a,0,588
headline,0,588
like,0,588
the,0,589
President,0,589
is,0,589
reversing,0,589

as,0,589
indeed,0,589
we,0,589
have,0,589
in,0,589
the,0,589

of,0,589
Iran,0,589
that,0,589
's,0,589
not,0,589

if,0,589
you,0,589
find,0,589
you,0,589
're,0,589
on,0,589
the,0,589

No,0,593
I,0,593
actually,0,593
think,0,593
the,0,593

is,0,593
a,0,593
perfectly,0,594

's,0,595
go,0,595

at,0,597

with,0,597
the,0,597
North,0,598
Koreans,0,598
is,0,598
not,0,598
only,0,598
that,0,598
they,0,598
have,0,598
a,0,598

in,0,598
the,0,598

uh,0,598
in,0,598
dealing,0,598
with,0,598
North,0,598
Korea,0,598
diplomacy,0,598
has,0,598

we,0,600

diplomatically,0,600
/.,0,600
uh,0,601
there,0,601
's,0,601
almost,0,601
nothing,0,601
we,0,601
can,0,601
do,0,601
short,0,601
of,0,601
military,0,602

an,0,604

of,0,604

in,0,605

/.,0,605
But,0,606
the,0,606
real,0,606
levers,0,606
on,0,606
Kim,0,606

-,0,606

are,0,606
the,0,607
Chinese,0,607
and,0,607
the,0,607
South,0,607
Koreans,0,607
/.,0,607
It,0,608
is,0,608
they,0,608
who,0,608
essentially,0,608
support,0,608
the,0,608
regime,0,608
economically,0,608
and,0,608
politically,0,609
/.,0,609
But,0,610
makes,0,610
sense,0,610
to,0,610
have,0,610
them,0,610
at,0,610
the,0,610
table,0,610
/.,0,610
The,0,611
six,0,611

I,0,611
totally,0,611
agree,0,611
with,0,611
my,0,611
colleagues,0,611
here,0,612
have,0,612
produced,0,612
nothing,0,612

except,0,612
a,0,612
quadrupling,0,612

now,0,612

they,0,613
've,0,613
been,0,613

three,0,613

so,0,614
/.,0,614

the,0,615

that,0,615
/-,0,615
there,0,616

The,0,619
Chinese,0,619

not,0,619

uh,0,621
they,0,621
've,0,621

they,0,622

they,0,622
can,0,623
also,0,623
wield,0,623
/.,0,623
I,0,624
think,0,624
on,0,624
our,0,624
side,0,624
um,0,624
it,0,624
matters,0,624
less,0,624
who,0,624
else,0,625
is,0,625
at,0,625
the,0,625
table,0,625
than,0,625
that,0,625
we,0,625
have,0,625
our,0,625
own,0,625
wits,0,625
about,0,625
us,0,625
as,0,625
we,0,625
sit,0,625

with,0,625
the,0,625
North,0,625
Koreans,0,625
/.,0,625
And,0,626
our,0,626
government,0,626
I,0,626
believe,0,626
has,0,626
been,0,626
divided,0,626
over,0,626
the,0,626
last,0,627
few,0,627
years,0,627
as,0,627
the,0,627
six,0,627
party,0,627
talks,0,627
between,0,627
two,0,627
camps,0,627
/.,0,627
One,0,628
camp,0,628
which,0,628
believes,0,628
that,0,628
we,0,628
have,0,628
to,0,628
give,0,628
diplomacy,0,628
a,0,629
try,0,629
and,0,629
is,0,629

about,0,629
pursuing,0,629
diplomacy,0,629

But,0,630
there,0,630
's,0,630
another,0,630
camp,0,630
uh,0,630
in,0,630
this,0,630
country,0,630
and,0,630
I,0,631
think,0,631
represented,0,631
in,0,631
the,0,631
government,0,631
that,0,631
believes,0,631
that,0,631
negotiating,0,631
with,0,631
the,0,631
North,0,631
Koreans,0,631
is,0,631
a,0,631
fools,0,631
game,0,631
or,0,631
is,0,631
even,0,631
immoral,0,631
because,0,631
of,0,631
the,0,631
nature,0,631
of,0,631
the,0,631
regime,0,631

I,0,632
do,0,632
n't,0,632
agree,0,632

that,0,632

because,0,632
I,0,632
think,0,632
it,0,633
's,0,633
more,0,633
immoral,0,633
to,0,633
let,0,633
North,0,633
Korea,0,633
go,0,633
nuclear,0,633
than,0,633
to,0,633
try,0,633
to,0,633
reach,0,633
a,0,633
deal,0,633
with,0,633
North,0,633
Korea,0,633

But,0,634
we,0,634

/.,0,634
and,0,635
therefore,0,635
I,0,635
do,0,635
n't,0,635

we,0,635
at,0,635
the,0,635

has,0,636
been,0,636
as,0,636

we,0,636
might,0,636
have,0,636
been,0,636
/.,0,636
you,0,637
showed,0,637

I,0,652

By,0,653
the,0,653

I,0,653
would,0,653

we,0,653
should,0,653
have,0,653
that,0,653
same,0,654
position,0,654
today,0,654
That,0,654
is,0,654
if,0,654

I,0,666
thought,0,666
long,0,666
and,0,667
hard,0,667
about,0,667
this,0,667
/.,0,667
and,0,668
we,0,668
thought,0,668
that,0,668
this,0,668
was,0,668
a,0,668
relatively,0,668
nonprovocative,0,668

Now,0,670
I,0,670
have,0,670
to,0,670
emphasize,0,670

risk,0,670
in,0,670

you,0,672

I,0,673
have,0,673
to,0,673

there,0,673
's,0,673
risk,0,673

Governor,0,675

well,0,675
how,0,675
do,0,675
you,0,675
think,0,675
the,0,675
North,0,675
Koreans,0,675
would,0,676
react,0,676
if,0,676
we,0,676
took,0,676
out,0,676

/?,0,676
Well,0,677
I,0,677
respectfully,0,677
disagree,0,677
with,0,677
Assistant,0,677

Carter,0,677
there,0,677
/.,0,677
But,0,678
at,0,678

he,0,678
's,0,678
got,0,678
a,0,678
new,0,678
idea,0,678
which,0,678
the,0,679
administration,0,679
does,0,679
not,0,679
put,0,679
forth,0,679
/.,0,679
I,0,680
think,0,680
if,0,680
we,0,680
are,0,680
seriously,0,680
attacked,0,680
or,0,680
threatened,0,680
",",0,680
that,0,681
missile,0,681
which,0,681
was,0,681
a,0,681
test,0,681
was,0,681
geared,0,681
to,0,681
the,0,681
United,0,681

or,0,681
to,0,681
our,0,681

we,0,681
have,0,681
allied,0,681
responsibilities,0,681
with,0,681
South,0,681
Korea,0,681
or,0,681
Japan,0,681
/.,0,681
/.,0,681
Uh,0,682
you,0,682
do,0,682
take,0,682
that,0,682
step,0,682
/.,0,682
but,0,683
the,0,683
fact,0,683
is,0,683
that,0,683
you,0,683
risk,0,683
uh,0,683
the,0,683
uh,0,683
North,0,684
Koreans,0,684
shooting,0,684
missiles,0,684
at,0,684
South,0,684
Korea,0,684
/.,0,684
and,0,685
we,0,685
've,0,685
got,0,685
thirty,0,685
seven,0,685

the,0,686
DMZ,0,686
/.,0,686
Uh,0,687
but,0,687
Tim,0,687
I,0,687
think,0,687
another,0,687
reason,0,687
for,0,687
the,0,687
face,0,687
to,0,688
face,0,688
talks,0,688
is,0,688
that,0,688
there,0,688
're,0,688
two,0,688
issues,0,688
that,0,688
are,0,688
separate,0,688
from,0,688
the,0,688
six,0,688
party,0,688
talks,0,688
that,0,688
are,0,688
a,0,688
serious,0,688
grievance,0,688
in,0,688
our,0,688
relationship,0,688
/.,0,688
one,0,689
is,0,689
the,0,689
fact,0,689
that,0,689
we,0,689
have,0,689
frozen,0,689
financial,0,689
assets,0,689
of,0,690
the,0,690
North,0,690
Koreans,0,690
/.,0,690
I,0,691
believe,0,691
rightly,0,691
so,0,691
/.,0,691
but,0,692
that,0,692
is,0,692
a,0,692
separate,0,692
bilateral,0,692
issue,0,692
/.,0,692
The,0,693
second,0,693
is,0,693
our,0,693
objection,0,693
to,0,693
dealing,0,693
with,0,693
North,0,693
Koreans,0,693
',0,694
request,0,694
for,0,694
a,0,694
light,0,694
water,0,694
reactor,0,694
Which,0,694
I,0,694
believe,0,694
has,0,694
bogged,0,694
down,0,694
the,0,694
six,0,694
party,0,694
talks,0,694
/.,0,694
Which,0,695
by,0,695
the,0,695
way,0,695
I,0,695
believe,0,695
you,0,695
could,0,695
have,0,695
a,0,695
separate,0,696
bilateral,0,696
face,0,696
to,0,696
face,0,696
negotiation,0,696
with,0,696
the,0,696
United,0,696
States,0,696
and,0,696
also,0,696
continue,0,696
the,0,696
efforts,0,696
with,0,696
the,0,696
six,0,696
party,0,696
talks,0,696
because,0,696
it,0,696
is,0,696
the,0,696
South,0,696
Koreans,0,696
and,0,696
the,0,696
Japanese,0,696
that,0,696
are,0,696
providing,0,696
financial,0,696
and,0,696
fuel,0,696
incentives,0,696
/.,0,696
So,0,697
you,0,697
ca,0,697
n't,0,697
cut,0,697
them,0,697
out,0,697
/.,0,697
but,0,698
I,0,698
think,0,698
it,0,698
's,0,698
essential,0,698
to,0,698
have,0,698
face,0,698
to,0,698

But,0,700
in,0,700
the,0,700
end,0,700
it,0,700
's,0,700

You,0,702

a,0,704
few,0,704
weeks,0,704
before,0,704
the,0,704

I,0,705
do,0,705
n't,0,705

're,0,705

And,0,706
they,0,706
did,0,706
/.,0,706
No,0,707
Tim,0,707
I,0,707
said,0,707
I,0,707
believe,0,707
that,0,707
they,0,707
were,0,707
going,0,707

I,0,709
did,0,709

that,0,709
/.,0,709
And,0,710
what,0,710
I,0,710
sense,0,710
in,0,710
my,0,710
negotiations,0,710
in,0,710
dealing,0,710

/-,0,711
You,0,712
said,0,712
as,0,712
days,0,712
go,0,712

I,0,712
do,0,712
n't,0,712

're,0,713

But,0,714
early,0,714
on,0,714
I,0,714
said,0,714
that,0,714
they,0,714
did,0,714
on,0,714
CBS,0,714
/.,0,715
Uh,0,716
my,0,716
point,0,716
is,0,716
that,0,716
when,0,716
you,0,716
deal,0,716
with,0,716
North,0,716
Korea,0,717
you,0,717
're,0,717

Do,0,718
n't,0,718
believe,0,718
in,0,718

they,0,719
believe,0,719
in,0,719
their,0,719
only,0,719
way,0,719
or,0,719
the,0,719
highway,0,719
/.,0,719
Their,0,720
view,0,720
is,0,720
that,0,720
their,0,720
cause,0,720
is,0,720
right,0,720
/.,0,720
and,0,721
they,0,721
're,0,721

with,0,723
them,0,723
and,0,724
we,0,724
have,0,724
shown,0,724
that,0,724
effectively,0,724
in,0,724
past,0,724

the,0,730

are,0,839

thinking,0,839
/?,0,839
Well,0,840
I,0,840
'm,0,840
concerned,0,840
that,0,840
they,0,840
're,0,840
thinking,0,840
that,0,840
we,0,840
're,0,841
giving,0,841
a,0,841
new,0,841
meaning,0,841
to,0,841
the,0,841
word,0,841
intolerable,0,841
Because,0,841
they,0,841
keep,0,841
doing,0,841
things,0,841
that,0,841
we,0,841
say,0,841
are,0,841
intolerable,0,841
and,0,841
then,0,841
we,0,841
tolerate,0,841
them,0,841
/.,0,841
That,0,842
's,0,842
why,0,842
I,0,842
think,0,842
at,0,842
some,0,842
point,0,842
you,0,842
have,0,842
to,0,843
draw,0,843
the,0,843
line,0,843
with,0,843
the,0,843
North,0,843
Koreans,0,843
/.,0,843
I,0,844
do,0,844
think,0,844
and,0,844
here,0,844
I,0,844
agree,0,844
with,0,844
both,0,844
of,0,844
the,0,845
other,0,845
gentlemen,0,845
you,0,845
have,0,845
on,0,845
the,0,845
show,0,845
who,0,845
have,0,845
shown,0,845
it,0,845
's,0,845
possible,0,845
to,0,845
reach,0,845
an,0,845
agreement,0,845
with,0,845
North,0,845
Korea,0,845
and,0,845
to,0,845
get,0,845
agreements,0,845
that,0,845
serve,0,845
our,0,845
interests,0,845
The,0,845
much,0,845
maligned,0,845
agreed,0,845
framework,0,845
as,0,845
Bob,0,845
Galluci,0,845
pointed,0,845
out,0,845
without,0,845
that,0,845

by,0,845
all,0,845
the,0,845

now,0,845
have,0,845
fifty,0,845

So,0,846
we,0,846
were,0,846
better,0,846
off,0,846
with,0,846
the,0,846
agreement,0,846

without,0,846
it,0,847

It,0,848
is,0,848
possible,0,848
to,0,848
reach,0,848
agreement,0,848
with,0,848
the,0,848
North,0,848
Koreans,0,848
But,0,849
not,0,849
when,0,849
they,0,849
see,0,849
the,0,849
kind,0,849
of,0,849

that,0,849
you,0,849

is,0,849

and,0,852
as,0,852
I,0,852
suggested,0,852

the,0,852

do,0,859
you,0,859
have,0,859
any,0,859

that,0,860
/?,0,860
The,0,861
North,0,861
Koreans,0,861
in,0,861
my,0,861
dealings,0,861
with,0,861
them,0,861
they,0,861
care,0,861
more,0,862
about,0,862

than,0,862
they,0,862
do,0,862
substance,0,862
/.,0,862
In,0,863
your,0,863
earlier,0,863
segment,0,863
you,0,863
showed,0,863
president,0,863
Bush,0,863
calling,0,863
him,0,863
a,0,864
tyrant,0,864

But,0,865
then,0,865
later,0,865

called,0,865

/.,0,866
I,0,867
was,0,867
in,0,867

when,0,867
that,0,867
happened,0,867
/.,0,867
The,0,868
North,0,868
Koreans,0,868
were,0,868
delighted,0,868
because,0,868
they,0,868
felt,0,868

And,0,871
this,0,871
is,0,871
another,0,871
reason,0,871

I,0,871
think,0,871
for,0,871

who,0,872
again,0,872
is,0,872
very,0,872
competent,0,872

believe,0,872
would,0,872
set,0,872
the,0,872

for,0,872

is,0,872

is,0,872
basically,0,872

's,0,877

that,0,878
's,0,878
right,0,878

that,0,879
's,0,879
in,0,879

negotiated,0,879

My,0,881
point,0,881

serves,0,882
as,0,882
a,0,882

also,0,882
deals,0,882
with,0,882

now,0,882

think,0,882
the,0,882
timing,0,882
is,0,882
right,0,882
for,0,882
this,0,882

you,0,883
believe,0,883
the,0,883

would,0,884
give,0,884

they,0,884

do,0,885
n't,0,885
know,0,885
/.,0,886
Um,0,887
but,0,887
that,0,887
leaves,0,887
me,0,887
to,0,887
conclude,0,887
since,0,887
I,0,887
really,0,887
do,0,888
n't,0,888
know,0,888
that,0,888
it,0,888
's,0,888
a,0,888
good,0,888
idea,0,888
to,0,888
find,0,888
out,0,888
/.,0,888
It,0,889
's,0,889
a,0,889
good,0,889
idea,0,889
it,0,889
was,0,889
in,0,889
nineteen,0,889
ninety,0,889
four,0,890
to,0,890
do,0,890
a,0,890
deal,0,890
with,0,890
the,0,890
North,0,890
that,0,890
required,0,890
them,0,890
to,0,890
give,0,890
up,0,890
the,0,890
program,0,890
/.,0,890
We,0,891
did,0,891
that,0,891
/.,0,891
and,0,892
for,0,892
a,0,892
period,0,892
of,0,892
years,0,892
we,0,892
were,0,892
in,0,892
a,0,892
position,0,893
to,0,893
monitor,0,893
that,0,893
closely,0,893
/.,0,893
and,0,894
they,0,894
did,0,894
give,0,894
it,0,894
up,0,894
/.,0,894
Indeed,0,895
you,0,895
can,0,895
make,0,895
an,0,895
argument,0,895
that,0,895
while,0,895
the,0,895
centrifuge,0,895
program,0,896
with,0,896
the,0,896
Pakistanis,0,896
is,0,896
clearly,0,896
cheating,0,896
was,0,896
n't,0,896
yet,0,896
a,0,896
genuine,0,896
nuclear,0,896

n't,0,896

probably,0,896
still,0,896
has,0,896
n't,0,896
produced,0,896
anything,0,896

So,0,897
you,0,897
have,0,897
the,0,897
possibility,0,897
if,0,897
the,0,897
North,0,897

are,0,897

the,0,898
